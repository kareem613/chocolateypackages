chocolateypackages
==================

This repo includes chocolatey packages for my development environment. It's a quick way to get all my favourite tools installed quickly. 
It's broken up into three packages. 

kareemsultan.developer.toolkit
This package includes many of the tools I use for my daily development including console2, fiddler, filezilla, notepad++, and sysinternals.

kareemsultan.developer.toolkit.dotnet
This package includes many of the tools I use for my daily .NET development. 

kareemsultan.desktop
This package includes many of the apps I use every day.

 

Install with chocolatey (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey).
cinst kareemsultan.developer.toolkit 
cinst kareemsultan.developer.toolkit.dotnet
cinst kareemsultan.desktop
