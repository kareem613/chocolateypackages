http://maybe5.com/chocolatey-dev-system-packages/

This repo includes chocolatey packages for my development environment. Inspired by Fervent Coder (http://geekswithblogs.net/robz), it's a quick way to get all my favourite tools installed quickly. 
I primarily created this to setup my new laptop quickly and keep it updated painlessly using chocolately. (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey)
It's broken up into three packages. 

### kareemsultan.developer.toolkit
This package includes many of the general tools I use for my daily development. Details at http://chocolatey.org/packages/kareemsultan.developer.toolkit. 

### kareemsultan.developer.toolkit.dotnet
This package includes many of the tools I use for my daily .NET development. Details at http://chocolatey.org/packages/kareemsultan.developer.toolkit.dotnet. 

### kareemsultan.desktop
This package includes many of the apps I use every day. Details at http://chocolatey.org/packages/kareemsultan.desktop.
